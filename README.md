    terrain types:
      
      - "normal": metal ground, no modifiers
      
      - "wall" : impenetrable barrier
      
      - fire: causes fire damage, increased movement speed
      
      - water: if robot is heavily damaged, might cause short circuit damage, greatly reduced movement speed
      
      - earth: reduced movement speed
      
      - air: (hole) causes fall damage, immobilizes for a few seconds
      
      - portal: teleports robot to another portal randomly, random damage or healing and power up
      
    general:
      
      - 1000*1000px
      
      - 10*10px per tile
      
      - different textures for tiles
      
      - origin (0, 0) upper left corner
