## Week 3

How the game could be structured:

main menu

  - singleplayer
  - multiplayer (2players on one keyboard, wasd, arrow keys,...)
  - settings (general movement speed, robot health, damage,...)
  - quit game

in-game

  - full map shown on screen
  - different textures for tiles
  - countdown to start
  - exit on esc


## Week 2

We created the repository and Github.io pages and invited all team members and the tutors.

After that we created a program with an empty window and added the flake8 test workflow.

After opening a pull request, the check ran fine and another team member could comment/review, as seen in the last two screenshots.
